STRLCPY(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    STRLCPY(3)

NAME
	 strlcpy, strlcat -- size-bounded string copying and concatenation

LIBRARY
	 Standard C	Library	(libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
	 #include <string.h>

	 size_t
	 strlcpy(char * restrict dst, const	char * restrict	src, size_t dstsize);

	 size_t
	 strlcat(char * restrict dst, const	char * restrict	src, size_t dstsize);

DESCRIPTION
	 The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions copy	and concatenate	strings	with
	 the same input parameters and output result as snprintf(3).  They are de-
	 signed to be safer, more consistent, and less error prone replacements
	 for the easily misused functions strncpy(3) and strncat(3).

	 strlcpy() and strlcat() take the full size	of the destination buffer and
	 guarantee NUL-termination if there	is room.  Note that room for the NUL
	 should be included	in dstsize.

	 strlcpy() copies up to dstsize - 1	characters from	the string src to dst,
	 NUL-terminating the result	if dstsize is not 0.

	 strlcat() appends string src to the end of	dst.  It will append at	most
	 dstsize - strlen(dst) - 1 characters.  It will then NUL-terminate,	unless
	 dstsize is	0 or the original dst string was longer	than dstsize (in prac-
	 tice this should not happen as it means that either dstsize is incorrect
	 or	that dst is not	a proper string).

	 If	the src	and dst	strings	overlap, the behavior is undefined.

RETURN VALUES
	 Besides quibbles over the return type (size_t versus int) and signal han-
	 dler safety (snprintf(3) is not entirely safe on some systems), the fol-
	 lowing two	are equivalent:

	   n = strlcpy(dst, src, len);
	   n = snprintf(dst, len, "%s",	src);

	 Like snprintf(3), the strlcpy() and strlcat() functions return the	total
	 length of the string they tried to	create.	 For strlcpy() that means the
	 length of src.  For strlcat() that	means the initial length of dst	plus
	 the length	of src.

	 If	the return value is >= dstsize,	the output string has been truncated.
	 It	is the caller's	responsibility to handle this.

EXAMPLES
	 The following code	fragment illustrates the simple	case:

	   char	*s, *p,	buf[BUFSIZ];

	   ...

	   (void)strlcpy(buf, s, sizeof(buf));
	   (void)strlcat(buf, p, sizeof(buf));

	 To	detect truncation, perhaps while building a pathname, something	like
	 the following might be used:

	   char	*dir, *file, pname[MAXPATHLEN];

	   ...

	   if (strlcpy(pname, dir, sizeof(pname)) >= sizeof(pname))
		   goto	toolong;
	   if (strlcat(pname, file, sizeof(pname)) >= sizeof(pname))
		   goto	toolong;

	 Since it is known how many	characters were	copied the first time, things
	 can be sped up a bit by using a copy instead of an	append:

	   char	*dir, *file, pname[MAXPATHLEN];
	   size_t n;

	   ...

	   n = strlcpy(pname, dir, sizeof(pname));
	   if (n >= sizeof(pname))
		   goto	toolong;
	   if (strlcpy(pname + n, file,	sizeof(pname) -	n) >= sizeof(pname) - n)
		   goto	toolong;

	 However, one may question the validity of such optimizations, as they de-
	 feat the whole purpose of strlcpy() and strlcat().	 As a matter of	fact,
	 the first version of this manual page got it wrong.

HISTORY
	 The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions first appeared in OpenBSD 2.4, and
	 FreeBSD 3.3.

#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
		strlcpy() and strlcat() take the full size of the destination buffer
	 and guarantee NUL-termination if there is room.  Note that room for
	 the NUL should be included in dstsize.

	 strlcpy() copies up to dstsize - 1 characters from the string src to
	 dst, NUL-terminating the result if dstsize is not 0.
		
	-strlcpy is a less ambiguous version of strncpy. 
	Unlike strncpy, strlcpy *always* null-terminates 
	the destination dest for non-zero sizes size.
	size_t strlcpy (char *dest, const char *src, size_t size);

-Copy characters from src to dest and null-terminate the resulting string.

-Up to size - 1 characters are copied to dest.

-size should be the size of the destination string buffer dest plus the space for the null-terminator. size may be computed in many cases using the sizeof operator.

-strlcpy is a less ambiguous version of strncpy. 
Unlike strncpy, strlcpy *always* null-terminates 
the destination dest for non-zero sizes size. 

-strlcpy returns the length of the string whether or not 
it was possible to copy it all -- this makes it easier 
to calculate the required buffer size.

If dest and src are overlapping buffers, the behavior is
 undefined. One possible result is a buffer overrun - 
 accessing out-of-bounds memory.

### **Return Value**

The length of the string that strlcpy tried to create is 
returned, whether or not strlcpy could store it in dest. 
If all of src was copied, the return value will be 
less than size.

- c02 - ex11: main goal for this exercise was converting
 decimal to hexadecimal I watched this video to understand 
 this process even though I did not finish it yet: 
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJW6qnfhC70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJW6qnfhC70)
	- c02- ex09: I looked at this exercise and instantly 
	solved bug that I couldnâ€™t fix beforeðŸ˜ƒ. 
	My bug was first char. beginning of the string 
	there could be non printable characters. 
	So finding that which index str has alpha_numeric 
	was helpful.
